            <h2>Hi there, I'm Evan</h2>
            <p>I have a B.S. in Computer Engineering along with a minor in Computer Science. I'm a self-taught Full Stack Web Developer and one of the founders and previous web master of <a href="https://cyberatuc.org">Cyber@UC</a>.</p>
            <p>I've been invested ever since I discovered web dev. My interest was piqued during an internship when I was told there wasn't going to be future work for some time. The first couple of days I tried to find something to do but that ran dry. After awhile I got restless because I don't like wasting my time, so I decided to dive in to the world of web dev.</p>

        <p>During my free time in college, I deepened my web dev knowledge. This was a growing passion for me and I couldn't stop. All of my time spent eventually opened a door to a web dev job. I struggled during the interview because I didn't have real world experience. They weren't sure I could handle the work, but the company gave me a shot and offered me the job. Ever since then, I've had multiple web dev jobs and I continuously expand my knowledge to this day.</p>
