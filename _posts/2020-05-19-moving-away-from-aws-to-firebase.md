## AWS is complicated

My first point is AWS is too complicated. When you first enter their site, you are greeted with an endless amount of menus and a bunch of vague names for each of their services. If all you want to do is host a static website, this method has a steep learning curve. I chose to host my website on AWS because I wanted to learn more about Cloud Computing. Getting started isn't that hard but immediately when you enter AWS there are endless amounts of menus and you have no idea what names mean what. It's all just a garbled mess.

Firebase took me probably around 30 minutes to get setup. Plus, their GUI is a lot more user-friendly and looks more modern. It feels like the developers acutally thought about the users who user their product, and honestly seeing Firebase was a breath of fresh air.

## Documentation

Amazon's documentation is not helpful.
